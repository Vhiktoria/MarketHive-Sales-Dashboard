# Building My Supermarket Sales Dashboard with Excel — A Data Analysis Project

This is my final capstone project for the Dash and Tell Bootcamp. I created a fictional retail brand called **Markethive** and analyzed supermarket sales data using Excel. The goal was to explore sales performance, customer behavior, and payment preferences — then bring it all together in an interactive dashboard using branded visuals.

## Project Overview
- **Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel  
- **Theme:** Supermarket/Retail  
- **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle – Supermarket Sales Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faresashraf1001/supermarket-sales?resource=download))

## Problem Statement
How can a retail brand like Markethive use daily transaction data to improve sales, customer satisfaction, and performance across product lines, cities, and time periods?

## Objectives
- Discover top-selling product lines  
- Analyze sales trends over time and by location  
- Explore customer satisfaction based on ratings  
- Understand payment preferences and shopping patterns  
- Build a dashboard that communicates insights clearly

## Data Cleaning
- Formatted inconsistent date values  
- Created new columns for *Month*, *Day of Week*, *Time Period*  
- Removed blanks and standardized number formats  
- Trimmed extra spaces and fixed data types

## What I Learned

This project helped me apply everything I’ve learned — from cleaning raw data to visual storytelling through dashboards. I enjoyed building a fictional brand, working with real data, and building something that mirrors real business needs.
